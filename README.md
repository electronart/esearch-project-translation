# Help translate eSearch Pro and TARILIO Pro into your language.

## Translating

Use our FREE Language File Editor

Download from here: https://dtsearch.co.uk/news/product/language-file-editor/

The Help file includes instructions for translation. 


## Staying up-to-date

Merge conflicts can happen if you're translating an outdated version of the template.lang file, part of which might have been translated by someone else. 

To prevent this, download and install the latest release of eSearch Pro right before you translate. The template.lang file can be found under C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\eSearch\i18n\

Alternatively fork the esearch project itself: https://github.com/electronart/esearch-project/tree/master/eSearch/i18n
